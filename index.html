      </div>
      <p>Hi, I’m Jess Jess! 👋 </p>

      <p>I’m a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Western Australia, and this is my very first website (so be kind to it, please!).</p>
      <p>While I might say I’m outgoing and extroverted, the truth is I’m more of an introvert at heart. But hey, everyone needs a bit of mystery, right? </p>
        <p>I love languages ! I speak three fluently but have dabbled in seven over the years (Indonesian, German, Japanese, Thai, Mandarin, Cantonese, English)(though, let’s be real, I’ve probably forgotten half of them). Whether it’s learning to code or trying to pick up new words in a foreign language, I’m always excited about exploring and creating.
        </p>
        Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you enjoy getting to know me a little better through this site!

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
        <p>I was born on October 19, 2003. I came into this world equipped with two arms, two legs, two eyes, and two ears—fully functional! Oh, and thankfully, a mouth and nose to match. Lucky me!</p>

        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>Currently, I don’t have a full-time job (yet!), but I keep myself busy with two part-time jobs and two internships. Yep, four roles at once—call it insane or ambitious, but that’s how I roll!</p>

      <div class="Education">
        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>I’m pursuing a Bachelor of Science at the University of Western Australia, majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Data Science. This will most likely be my last degree because, let’s be honest, I’m so done with studying. </p>
           <p>When the books are closed, you’ll find me rewarding myself with some delicious burgers—study fuel.</p>
